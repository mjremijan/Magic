			<h1>Curriculum</h1>
			<p>
			Children will have opportunities for learning by doing, self-expression and 
			participation in a variety of creative activities.  Activities will be planned 
			in the areas of language arts, social studies, science, mathematics, health, 
			music and motor development.  Television will not be offered, nor will videos
			be shown.  
			</p>
			<p>
			In order to gather meaning of their world, infants and toddlers will be
			nurtured and guided to explore sensory (touch, smell, hear, see, and taste) 
			and sensory-motor (kicking, rolling, crawling, etc) experiences.  
			</p>
			<p>
			Curriculum Benchmarks coincide with the Illinois State Board of Education’s Early
			Learning Standards.  Curriculum is developed by assessing every child individually 
			and using that information to develop a program that ensures that each child’s needs
			are met.
			</p>
			<p>
			Magic Building Block is an open-ended program which will prepare children to use their creative
			and intellectual abilities.  As you tour our center, you will see:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A variety of manipulatives and games</li>
				<li>Materials to enhance artistic, dramatic, and block play</li>
				<li>
					Ideas and things to talk about, relate to, compare with, match, 
					fit into, try out, reinforce, invent, discover, and enjoy
				</li>
				<li>Opportunities to "do it myself"</li>

			</ul>
